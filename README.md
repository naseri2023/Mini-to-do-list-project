# Mini-to-do-list-project
A simple and interactive To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project allows users to add tasks to a list by typing into an input box and pressing the Enter key. Each task is displayed with a delete button (represented by a trash can icon) to remove the task when it's no longer needed. If the user attempts to add an empty task, an error message is displayed to prompt them to enter a task. This project demonstrates basic DOM manipulation, event handling, and form validation.
